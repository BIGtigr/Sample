## Future project development for pyvolve python library. SJS. ##

### Near future
1. Many more example files
2. Parser for a simple control file and a "main" to go along with. 



### More distinct future
1. Indels!

2. *Possibly* incoporporate branch-geneologies (evolve a "population" along a branch and then sample from this population for the final node. This draw can either be done randomly or we can specifically take the WT genotype).

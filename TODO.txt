## Future project development for pyvolve python library. SJS. ##

### Near future
1. Incorporate codon model heterogeneity. This is distinct from rate heterogeneity used in nucleotide/amino acid models, as a different matrix is required for each codon model.



### More distinct future
1. Indels!

2. *Possibly* incoporporate branch-geneologies (evolve a "population" along a branch and then sample from this population for the final node. This draw can either be done randomly or we can specifically take the WT genotype).
